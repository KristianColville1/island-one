# Welcome

## This is a personal python project

<p>Python is truly a versatile language, I intend to make good use of it and experiment with it in this project.</p>

### The truth

<p>The main idea for this is not set in stone as of yet. I have established what tools to use and a rough idea of the goal of this project.
I want to build a stand alone app that possibly contains a game that a user can interact with or a generic app with a purpose that helps a users needs.</p>

<p> I would like to build a basic game similar to the popular Mario or a personal automation app. We'll find out where my loyalty ends up as I get the main bits put together.</p>
